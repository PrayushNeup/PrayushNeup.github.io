            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p class="fs-5">When brainstorming on the types of pages I would include on the website, 
                I decided to add 5 pages that included the “Home Page”, resume, gallery to show my past
                 projects, contact information, and process document. To get some ideas on the design for
                  the Home page, I researched online for some ideas.  The image shown in Figure 1 gave me a
                   sense of how I wanted to structure the home page and so I did something similar because it
                    goes straight to the point and covers all the essentials for a quick introduction. I also
                     wanted to add something that would visually display my skills which is why I added the progress bar.
                      I added accordions because it highlights the important points of each category without being lengthy.
                       I added two call-to-action buttons that fall into associative navigation because it takes
                        users to the page that goes more in-depth about the information that is in that section.

            <h2>Resume</h2>
            <p class="fs-5">For the second page, I decided to make it look like a resume. 
                To determine the structure of the page, I look at some resume templates from
                 google Docs and chose the one shown in figure 2. I selected this format because
                  the structure seemed appropriate for the contents of my resume.

            <h2>Gallery</h2>
            <p class="fs-5">I wanted to include a page where it showcased my past projects
                 related that is related to web design/development in a certain way. I decided
                  to include my painting projects as doing them helped me to understand colour 
                  composition and visual principles. To do this, I chose to use cards because 
                  their design was ideal for how I wanted to display the paintings and their 
                  descriptions. I also chose to use the slideshow because it allows me to show 
                  the comparisons between the website created by Wix and my recreation of that 
                  website through HTML and CSS.

            <h2>Contact page</h2>
            <p class="fs-5">I believed having a contact information page was important 
                for a portfolio website which is why I included a form and added visual 
                dynamic features to it, shown in figure 4. This makes it clear to users the
                 information they need to add before sending it and gives feedback to let them
                know if it was valid or not.

            <h2>Colour Selection, Fonts, Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="fs-5">My website mainly consists of blue, orange and grey colours. 
                I chose these orange and blue made a good combination and are visually appealing.
                 It highlights the headings and the words maintain legibility without being too bright.
                  The background is grey so it is easy to read the information without making the page bland. 
                  These particular fonts are used so the website has good readability. Aria and alt labels are
                used wherever necessary for accessibility purposes.
